PPAPI for .NET
==============

Write PPAPI extensions for Chromium in your favorite .NET language.

This project is in very early prototype phase.
It can invoke a managed assembly using either the .NET Framework or CoreCLR.
But that's all it can do at present -- invoke it. It doesn't interact with
electron in any way yet.
